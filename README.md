# Electricity-Demand-Forecasting-Using-Machine-Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to forecast electricity demand based on historical data. The objective is to analyze seasonal trends and fluctuations to improve demand prediction accuracy. The project involves:
* Preprocessing historical electricity consumption data
* Selecting and training a predictive model
* Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics

## Features
* Data preprocessing and feature engineering
* Time series analysis for demand forecasting
* Implementation of various machine learning models
* Performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ²

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the model:
```bash
jupyter notebook ElectricityDemandForecasting.ipynb
```

## Results
* Model performance is evaluated using standard error metrics.
* Visualizations help in understanding demand trends.
